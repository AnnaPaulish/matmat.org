# Mathematics for materials modelling

Welcome to the website of the *Mathematics for materials modelling* (MatMat) research group.
We are a part of both
the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/)
and the
[Institute of Materials](https://sti.epfl.ch/imx/)
at EPFL.

We only got started recently at EPFL, so please bear with us
while this website is still a bit slim on content.
