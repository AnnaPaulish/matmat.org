## Accelerating structure optimisations using perturbative post-processing
High-throughput studies, where thousands to tens of thousands of materials are
simulated, are a powerful tool for broadening our knowledge of materials
properties and discovering new and interesting functional materials. A key step
in many of these studies is structure optimisation, in which an approximate
arrangement of atoms in a crystal is optimized to the most stable
configuration.

Since each iterative step of the associated with this optimisation is roughly
as expensive as a single-point calculation of ground state energy, atomic
structure optimisation accounts for a substantial amount of computational time
in high-throughput workflows. Additionally, the obtained minimal-energy
geometry can be highly dependent on the chosen numerical parameters for the
calculation, such as the basis set cutoff. Therefore, a good compromise between
the error of a too small cutoff and a too slow (but accurate) structure
optimisation needs to be found.

Along this direction, mathematical research has provided a number of new tools
in the past years to (a) estimate the numerical error due to basis set
discretisations and (b) correct for this error using post-processing
techniques. For the force as the key quantity of interest in structure
optimisations, a promising perturbative approach has emerged recently[^CDKL2022].
A preliminary implementation of this force-refinement strategy is already
available in the [density-functional toolkit (DFTK)](https://dftk.org).
DFTK is a software our group develops in collaboration with researchers all
across the world and which enables joint research between
mathematicians and scientists on first-principle materials simulations.

The goal of this project will be to integrate DFTK with [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/),
a software developed at the [THEOS group](http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/) here at EPFL.
AiiDA is a software framework written in Python
which simplifies and automates workflows for high-throughput studies. By
integrating DFTK with AiiDA, we want to both test the force refinement approach
on a broader range of systems and unlock this cheaper route to structure
optimisations for broader use.

**Requirements:**
Strong programming skills in particular python;
knowledge of Julia programming is a bonus, but can also be acquired as we go along;
interest in learning about the numerical and mathematical underpinnings of
first-principle based materials simulations.

## A mathematical look at modelling superconductor candidate materials with Hubbard corrections
The study of transition-metal compounds using density-functional theory (DFT) is an established approach
and has in the past been involved with the discovery of novel cathodes for Li batteries,
thermoelectric devises or photovoltaic materials. Recently the literature discussion surrounding
[LK-99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99) as a promising candidate for high-temperature
superconductivity is yet another example where DFT calculations are playing an important role
to understand the effects of the copper (transition metal) doping[^Lk99griffin] in the
lead phosphate apatite matrix. Unfortunately employing plain semi-local DFT is not sufficient
to capture the physics of many transition-metal compounds due to the strongly localised
and partially filled $d$-orbitals being inappropriately described. As a remedy the
so-called Hubbard corrections[^Hubbard] have been proposed and excessively studied
over the past years[^SelfConsistentU]. Practically all theoretical studies of LK-99
employ Hubbard corrections to make their predictions
(see e.g. the [list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99)).

Within DFTK Hubbard corrections are so far missing.
Moreover many fundamental mathematical and numerical aspects
surrounding Hubbard corrections are so far understudied.
As part of this project you will (a) implement Hubbard corrections into DFTK,
(b) use them to simulate the bands of LK-99,
and (c) investigate numerical techniques to improve the SCF convergence of DFT
calculations with Hubbard corrections (termed also DFT+U calculations).
The project will be conducted in collaboration
with the [THEOS group](http://theossrv1.epfl.ch/) here at EPFL.

**Requirements:**
Strong programming skills; basic knowledge of quantum mechanics in solid-state physics;
knowledge of Julia programming is a bonus, but can also be acquired as we go along;
interest in learning about the numerical and mathematical underpinnings of
first-principle based materials simulations.

## Performance optimisation of GPU routines in DFTK

DFTK currently provides preliminary support for running calculations on
CUDA-based graphics processing units (GPUs). Support for HIP-based GPU
(e.g. the ones by AMD) is on the way. In its current stage the GPU code
still requires substantial performance improvements to be competitive.
The main task of this project is to employ Julia's profiling and benchmarking
tools to assess and improve the GPU performance of DFTK. Along the lines
you will learn how GPU programming in Julia works and how to improve the
performance of a Julia code towards the HPC regime.

If time permits we might also target an extension of the overall GPU support in DFTK
towards new platforms (e.g. Intel) or new routines in DFTK.

**Requirements:**
Strong programming skills with experience in the implementation of algorithms
for high-performance computing;
knowledge of Julia programming is a bonus, but can also be acquired as we go along;
interest in learning Julia's hardware abstractions for GPU computing

## Tailored initial guesses for DFT using equivariant neural networks

Most commonly the energy minimisation underlying DFT is solved using the self-consistent
field procedure (SCF), which uses an iterative procedure to find the converged DFT
density as a fixed-point. To start the SCF iterations an initial guess density
is required, which most commonly is generated by simply adding the density of the
atoms of a corresponding molecule or solid (superposition guess). This is not only very simple,
but also works very well and for many practical applications SCF calculations
converge in less than 20 iterations.

However, in particular whenever the electronic structure is non-trivial
(e.g. magnetism, unusual spin polarisation), completely neglecting the electronic
interaction between atomic densities in the initial guess represents a severe
drawback. In practice often 40 or more SCF iteration can be required for
such cases to obtain convergence. Especially for this setting a data-driven
approach, which takes the *converged* densities from previous calculations
into account to predict an initial guess for a similar chemical system
is a promising approach. As has been noted in previous works[^uncertanties]
this requires considerable care to ensure that the data-driven initial guess
is truly an improvement over the simple, yet effective superposition guess.
Moreover especially for the tricky cases it is crucial to ensure that
natural symmetries in the problem are respected when the initial guess
is predicted, to not misguide the numerical procedure.

To overcome these challenges in this project we will employ equivariant
neural networks as implemented in the [e3nn](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)
package[^e3nn] in conjunction with [DFTK](https://dftk.org). This package
has in particular the capabilities to take appropriate symmetries
into account both when learning the network and when predicting.
Additionally we will employ strategies to monitor the uncertainties
of the predicted density guesses
such that we can safely target the challenging compounds,
where most can be gained from a better initial guess.
This project will be conducted in collaboration
with the [atomic architects group](https://atomicarchitects.github.io/) from MIT,
which develops e3nn.

**Requirements:**
Strong programming skills, ideally in Julia or Python;
basic knowledge of quantum mechanics in solid-state physics;
basic experience with data-driven methods or machine learning;
interest in learning about the numerical and mathematical underpinnings of
first-principle based materials simulations.

or iterative post-processing techniques.

## Curation of a benchmark set for mathematical research
The aim of this project is to use [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/)
in order to curate a dataset of test systems,
which can be used to automatically
test and benchmark algorithms
for density-functional theory.
This will be used both to compare the performance of DFTK
against other standard software in the field
and their respective algorithms.

**Requirements:**
Experience in running first-principle simulations in standard codes
such as VASP, ABINIT, QuantumEspresso; experience with AiiDA or DFTK is a bonus,
but can also be acquired as we go along.
