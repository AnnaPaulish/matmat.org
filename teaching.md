#### Summary
The students will learn key numerical techniques for solving standard
mathematical problems in science and engineering. The underlying mathematical
theory and properties are discussed.

#### Content
The topics covered include:

* Properties and issues with numerical computation
* Finding roots and fixed points
* Polynomial interpolation
* Solving linear and non-linear equations
* Gradient-based methods for solving linear and eigenproblems
* Numerical integration and differentiation
* Basic numerical techniques for solving differential equations
